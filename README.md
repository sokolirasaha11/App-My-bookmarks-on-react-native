### Starting and creating an application
The initial stage of any development. Here I will not touch on setting the expo or anything like that. Everything I write below assumes that you have little knowledge of working with react native( next rn ).
We start with the installation. Our main platform will be NativeBase. It adds ready-made native components to rn.
<p><code>expo init my-app --template @native-base/expo-template</code><p>
Perhaps. This concludes our first step. It was easy. But for a clear sequence of actions, it is necessary to separate it with another step.
